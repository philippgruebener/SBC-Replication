\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this document, we provide additional details about the replication of
 the empirical results of the paper.
 The replication material consists of two sets of files.
 First, to reproduce the main empirical results of the paper and replicate
 the figures and tables, use the following files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
AGGREGATE.xls 
\emph default
which contains aggregate time-series of annual GDP growth from FRED for
 the United States, quarterly GDP growth from FRED for the United States,
 cross-country annual GDP growth from the World Development Indicators,
 and cross-country quarterly GDP growth from the OECD Stats.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Census_LBD.xls 
\emph default
which contains the cross-sectional moments of the distribution of employment
 growth for establishments and firms from a sample of firms from the Census'
 Longitudinal Business Dataset (LBD).
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: Census-LBD"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 describes the available material in additional detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
USA_AND_CROSSCOUNTRY.xls
\emph default
 which contains the cross-sectional moments of the distribution of annual
 growth of quarterly sales, annual sales, and employment for publicly traded
 firms from Compustat, stock returns from CRSP, annual sales growth and
 employment growth for publicly traded firms from Bureau van Dijk's (BvD)
 Osiris database, and stock returns from Global Compustat.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec: USAandCountry"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 describes the available material in detail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
SBC_ReplicaEmpirics.do
\emph default
 takes the .xls files and replicates the main figures and empirical results
 of the paper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compustat and Global Compustat data were accessed via the Wharton Research
 Data Services (WRDS) and were last updated on April 13, 2018.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, if you wish to replicate the cross-sectional moments from the raw
 data and do your own calculations, use the following files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SBC_Clean_CSTAT.do takes the raw .dta at annual and quarterly frequency for
 the universe of firms in Compustat downloaded from WRDS and applies the
 selection criteria; upon completion, the code generates a clean dataset
 at the annual and quarterly frequencies and the time-series of cross-sectional
 moments used in the paper for sales, employment, and stock returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SBC_Clean_BvDOsiris.do takes the raw .csv at annual frequency for the universe
 of firms available in Bureau van Dijk's (BvD) Osiris dataset downloaded
 from WRDS and applies selection criteria; upon completion, the code generates
 a clean datasets at the country-annual frequency with the cross-sectional
 moments used in the paper for sales and employment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SBC_Clean_GCSTAT.do takes the raw .dta at daily stock returns for the universe
 of firms in the Global Compustat database downloaded from WRDS and applies
 the selection criteria; upon completion, the code generates a clean dataset
 at the country-quarterly level and the time-series of the cross-sectional
 moments used in the paper for stock returns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The do-files are heavily commented and we made the best of our efforts to
 make them bug-free.
 But in the case you of any question or find an error in the code, do not
 hesitate contact us.
 Be aware that the clean dataset created by these do-files might be larger
 than the raw dataset because of the large number of variables generated.
 The Excel file SBC_DataVariableList.xls contains the list of variables in
 the raw data used in the paper following the names of WRDS.
 Finally, the underlying data is not this packet but can be accessed through

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SBC Replica Empirics

\begin_layout Standard
The do file 
\emph on
SBC_ReplicaEmpirics.do
\emph default
 takes the data from the excel files and replicates the figures 2 to 7 and
 appendix figures 11 and 12.
 It also replicates the regression results for columns 1 to 9 in Table 2.
 Additional details can be found in the do-file and in the Appendix A.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
SBC_Census_LBD.xls 
\emph default
file contains different moments of the employment growth distribution across
 firms and establishments.
 To avoid the disclosure of sensitive information, all the reported percentiles
 and percentiles-based measures are calculated as the employment weighted
 average within a 1% centered band around the corresponding percentile (for
 instance, the 90th percentile is the average across all observations between
 the 89th and 91th percentiles).
 See appendix A for additional details on sample selection.
 The excel file 
\emph on
Census_LBD.xls 
\emph default
contains the following sheets and variables, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
