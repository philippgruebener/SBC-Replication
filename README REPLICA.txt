First version: March,08,2019
This version:  December,16,2019


This packet contains the replication files for the empirical results of Skewed Business Cycles by Salgado, Guvenen, and Bloom (December,2019)

We have tried our best to have a self-contained, self-explanatory, bug-free, set of do-files, but if you encounter any problem or have any suggestion to improve the codes, please contact Sergio Salgado at ssalgado@wharton.upenn.edu.

The packet contains the following folders

- replicationxls: contains the excel files to replicate the main results of the paper

- out: folder with the main results

- figs: saves the main figures and tables in the paper

- do: contains the main replication do-files. 
	The do-file SBC_ReplicaEmpirics replicates the main figures of the paper using the Excel files. 
	The do-file SBC_ReplicaVAR.do replicates the VAR estimates of the paper. Notice the IRF files are also part of this replication material (saved in /out). You can generate the main figures of the paper just by using those files directly

- agg: auxiliary datasets used in the construction of cross-sectional moments such as aggregate GDP per capita, CPI, etc. 

- raw: is a place holder where you can save the raw data. To replicate our results using raw data, see SBC_Data_Replicate.pdf. 

- txt: document with additional details on the empirical replication packet (SBC_Data_Replicate.pdf).
