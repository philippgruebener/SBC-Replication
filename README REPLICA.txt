First version: March,08,2019
This version : June,12,2019


This packet contains the replication files for the empirical results in Skewed Business Cycles by Salgado, Guvenen, and Bloom (2019)

We have tried our best to have a self-contained, self-explanatory, bug free, set of do-files, but if you encounter any problem or have some suggestions to make the codes better, please contact Sergio Salgado at salga010@umn.edu.

The packet contains the following folders

- txt: contains a pdf file with additional details of the replication materials
- replicationxls: contains the excel files to replicate the main results of the paper
- raw: place-holder folder, put your raw files there in case you want to replicate the results using the underlying data. See the SBC_Data_Replicate.pdf for additional details to get access to the raw data for replication purposes.
- out: folder with the main results

- figs: saves the main figures and table 2 of the paper
- do: contains the main replication do-files. The do-file SBC_ReplicaEmpirics replicates the main figures of the paper using the Excel files. The rest of the do-files construct the the cross-sectional moments using raw data. 
- agg: auxiliary datasets used in the construction of cross-sectional moments such as aggregate GDP per capita, CPI, etc.
